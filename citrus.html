          <p>
          A certain goodly teaching of the draoi, who knew the oak tree as the earth knew life, and who knew the beech tree as the earth knew the wreath-martyr (<mark>&#1502;&#1512;&#1499;&#1512;&#1504;&#1490;</mark>), for there is only beshedding within <mark>demiourgos</mark>.
          </p>
          <p>
          And it came to pass one day that the draoi happened upon a great coiden-tree, with a great multitude of citrus fruit upon its branches. And lo, I saw that the draoi received its essence and I was filled with a great curiosity, and I asked unto the draoi, Master, master, How was this fruit borne and what is its emanation, for verily I can see that you receive its essence and yea, it must surely be of goodliest frume.
          </p>
          <p>
          And behold, I became frightened, for in that moment the draoi spoke unto me, saying, Do you not already see and understand the magnificent essence of the citrus fruit, and the breath it imparts into every living thing and beast, but lo, I did not see and I did not understand.
          </p>
          <p>
          And I said unto the draoi, If it pleases you, reveal unto me the mathematics of the citrus fruit, so that I may understand and become like you, and ekewise that whosoever beholds also the mathematics of the citrus fruit may understand and become like you.
          </p>
          <p>
          Then the draoi began to teach, and I began to write.
