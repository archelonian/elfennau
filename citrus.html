          <p>
          The goodly teachings of the draoi, who knew the oak tree as the earth knew life herself, and as the earth knew the wreath-martyr (marwcoronog), for there is only beshedding within <mark>demiourgos</mark>.
          </p>
          <p>
          And it came to pass one day that the draoi happened upon a great coiden-tree, with a great multitude of citrus fruit upon its branches. And lo, I was filled with a great curiosity, and asked unto the draoi, Master, master, How was this fruit borne and what is its emanation, for verily I receive its essence and yea, it is surely of goodliest frume.
          </p>
          <p>
          But I was filled with a great tremor, for the draoi spoke unto me, Verily, though your health is drwggish, you shall oversty us all.
