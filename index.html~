        <p>
       The gate. The boundary. The crag. The wall. The chute. The signal. The cavern. The abyss. There are eight (8), why (why are there) are there eight (8), when the chakra number only seven (7) ?? Lo, it is because <mark>the signal</mark> is a false prophet.
        </p>
        <p>
       What, then, are the seven (7) ?? Behold, for they are the gate, the boundary, the crag, the <abbr title = "from Cy &lsaquo;hedfan&rsaquo; &quot;to fly&quot;">hedfanfa</abbr>, the swamp, the wall, and the abyss. I am terrified.
        </p>
        <p>
       Before I (the seven (7) elfennau) the seven (7) elfennau present, they did know it. Thus, therefore once again, we must (no). Must we (yes). Present it. And thus we must therefore. Yes. Here go we. The seeds of the pomegranate fall from their shell and we are deeply moved.
        </p>
        <p>
        The <mark>gate</mark> represents a transition state. From here to there, the old to the new. Is its colour then <mark>red</mark>. Primal fear and ignorance. That is its elfen: <mark>fear</mark>.
        </p>
        <p>
        The <mark>boundary</mark> represents the demarcation of the threshold. From here there cannot be any return. Thus, it is coloured <mark>white</mark>, not unlike the boundary itself, and its elfen is <mark>lust</mark>, and the desire for drwggishness.
        </p>
        <p>
        The <mark>crag</mark> represents <mark>despair</mark>. The crag is rough and unforgiving, and it is the oldest and trickiest. It is <mark>black</mark> of dust and old age.
        </p>
        <p>
        The <mark>hedfanfa</mark> represents <mark>aspiration</mark>. To penetrate the impenetratable, and to accomplish beyond the scope of dynhood is its goal. Like the burning sun, it is <mark>yellow</mark>.
        </p>
        <p>
        The <mark>swamp</mark> is where our uncertainties are buried. Coloured <mark>green</mark> like the swamp itself, it represents <mark>stability</mark>.
