          The gate. The boundary. The crag. The wall. The chute. The signal. The cavern. The abyss. There are eight (8), why (why are there) are there eight (8), when the chakra number only seven (7) ?? Lo, it is because <mark>the signal</mark> is a false prophet.
        </p>
        <p>
          What, then, are the seven (7) ?? Behold, for they are the gate, the boundary, the crag, the <abbr title = "from Cy &lsaquo;hedfan&rsaquo; &quot;to fly&quot;">hedfanfa</abbr>, the swamp, the wall, and the abyss. I am terrified.
        </p>

          Before I (the seven (7) elfennau) the seven (7) elfennau present, they did know it. Thus, therefore once again, we must (no). Must we (yes). Present it. And thus we must therefore. Yes.
