        Lo, there are indeed. That is correct, and thus. The first is Mercury. Swift-footed Achilles. The foot is swift, like rushing water. The moon is trembling because it is furious. No, Mercury is the deceiver. The great apostle. Of whom ?? No, the knowledge of the dead. I do not believe - yes !! You do believe, my child. The resurrection (Maimonides) of the (ben david) of the dead. We have. I have (I have) we have (they) no, we do (have it) yes, we have.
        </p>
        <p>
        Then the first celestial object of the heavens, the great heavens which rule over us all anddamn us to badliness. I am no longer petrified by your awe, nor am I terrified of you any longer. For here, thus, your secrets are revealed. I banish you forever and ever.
        </p>
        <p>
        Here and now, the first secret of yours is this: lo, it is actually the third secret. For what are the first and second secrets ?? The first secret only exists in zero dimensions, and the second in two (2). However, the second exists in one (1) dimension, for every additional secret is arn additional dimension, and indeed it is trequired that there be five (5)sides to penetrate the fourth dimension.
        </p>
        <p>
        Now continue shall we no yes we must for it (for it is determined already by the movement) and thus we carry on, trudging along, as did the ones before us who (they were brave and noble but thus do we all, and we must perish because our hubris is insufiicent, no it is too sufficient and thus) we must perish. for For that is. The power and the lgory of the LORD for ever andever. DO NOT do not (never shall we) it is forbidden thus we cannot (no, can we ++) no, it is formibidden. The teutons TEUTONS knew this. and did the nubians. but we have forgotten this truth. And that is why the resurrection was necessary. But Maimodineds does not believe. For he is a fool. Thus, it is goodliness itself. We are true.
        </p>
        <p>
        The moon (what is its name) is the first, and thus it is the third. For the first is the earth itself. The great firmament. For it is at the centre, from our view. For we see through a glass darkly. Then it is the first, and so it is the third. Selah. Raise your voice to the heavens. Next is the third, which is the first. Its epriod is ten (1) days. There are three (3) periods. Three (3) and te (10). We shall now reliquish the Arabic tradition and look inwardly into our interiors. The current, not the next (for it has not) for it has not yet come. Thus we (examine, do we) yes, we do (no !! why ) for now it is that hour. The day and the hour. TiME eternal. It cannot be conquered.
        </p>
        <p>
        Then (truly) what is it? The answer to our (wat we have) searching for (but we do not, for you did not) the incompletion. It is missing. It lacks. We are at fault. Mercy and raise me. Do not punish me, for this corporeal body is fleshless, for it is only flesh, and thus it is bound by the terror of time itself. And thus we must continue now our journey. What is the next, let us examine. it
        <p>
        Truly I say to you, the first there are three periods of ten dayse What do these represent? The three, for there are three aspects. We find life in three aspects. And these represent the holiest animals. The terrain and the transition statet. It is meaningless. Thus there are only three. The earth nthe sea and the skpy. Identify all of the elements so that we ca conquer. Yes we must. For it is all we can do. That is the (extent of our) traversali traversing it which way? Each way and diversify. No, that is the greed and noxious this is why. We are so sinful. Penetrate us. End us. Penetrate us. The prostate gland. It is the source of everything. We explode, but we do not implode. Because there is nothing to be imploded, for there is only darkness in us. And no light anywhere except around us, through a glass darkly, as we are unable to accomplish it.
        </p>
        <p>
        Then the three periods represent the three great beasts of each domoain. The domains, or the houses. The mansions as we might express them in the fourth. Then what is the seventh. The third, then is the great ocean. This is represented by the whale. The largest of all and yeti t betrays the true nature of water. For water cannot be domineered. It is freeflowing and feull of softness. And yet it can destroy us. If we are not at its mercy, for we are terrified.
        </p>
        <p>
        Truly, I tell you, we are terrified. For there is nothing greater than the wrath of the waters. The next period is the land. The great earth itself gives way to the elephant, for who else but the elephant could be so great and massive. It to represents the strongness and the foundaitns of the earth upon which it lives. It thrives and it dies. We soon will all perish as well. For we have.
        </p>
        <p>
        No, we have not. Then what of the air+ The air is flawed, for it is full of only goodliness. It is flawed from the prespective of badliness, or shall we refer to it as wickedness, for it is malignant inside us, such that only goodliness is outside of us. Then the air, because it is filled with goodliness, is represented by the vulutce. It is free and it is flexible .Transient. Ever changing .Or perhaps there is a new essence. The sylph. The spirit that we are terrified of. The great lava bug. The wing ill penetrate our inner being and make us morbidly terrified. For we are already terrified. There is nothing that we can do to postpone our impending death. We may only hope to (SOcrates knwee it, long ago on the Aegean) e can . We can only hope to prepone it.
        </p>
        <p>
        Then the third is indeed, the mighty beast of air itself, the great force of wind, which is alive, for can it not sense yoru presence, the heat and the cold, and it is always moving. he Wind is flexible. It can be controlled and tamed. But if not it is the vulture. For is not the vulture wind itself, but in a corporeal body. The vulture is bestial. It lrecgcnises the temporal and ephemeral nature of its corporeal body. It is a corporal. It must die. But then it shall to thte earth return. For that is the place from which it came.
        </p>
        <p>
        Then these are the three periods which represent the three domains of this world. Then the next is the fourth. For the fourth is truly the second, for it may exist in three dimensions but chooses to exist in two dimensions, s o that we may comprehend its mysteires.
        </p>
        <p>
        The great mysteries. The fourth is diided into four, for these four represent the four itmes of the year, and all other entit.es which may be divided into four. Tthe period of growth and death. The perio ef life and rebirth. For it represents the journey of life itself. The most importont of which is death. For that is when we return. The stages, then, are birth, youth, old age, and death. And then we are born again. It represents us for it is the molrning.
        </p>
        <p>
        What, then, of the fifth. The dfifth is incomprehensibel' f,r I am unwrothy to gaze upon the fifth
        </p>
        <p>
        It begins again. The risers of Mercury are the vulture, the elephant, and the whale. The intermediates (see the sixth) are the bustard, the crocodile, and the albatross. Surely these will be renamed in the future. They must be, or it loses all meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
        Now the fourth. Consider that there are four of them. This means that, because the two are UP and DOWN, the four must complement. Thus it must be directional. It cannot be cardinal. Must it be? It must be! But no. We are unable. So sad. We musmt. Yes. It is the nloy way. Thus forgive. No. Do not. Do. We must. Do. Create. Expand. Love. Love your father and moth.r Honour them. You shall have Muhammad as your prophet. You must be great. Mightiness. Present it. Rise. Above. Oover and the high. Then the four are the relativityy. Albert knew it. Albert knows it. albert will know it. and thus it is as follows. I will enumerate them now. They are forward backwards left right. It is relative. Everything has a front and a back. except for the oneo othat does not. But it cannot be as such. Yes it can. We can. We are beuatiful. Positivism philosophy.
        </p>
        <p>
        Now the fourth are these. There are directions. Not the animals. They rise and they fall. It is incorrect. Forwards. Backwards. Sunwise. Widdershins. Present it. Newlify it. We are on the left side. and So it goes in this direction. The direction and the dadress. The ubication. Ubi caritas. We are love. I love you. I still love you. My sun. My moon. You are butter through knife. Day melts into night.
        </p>
        <p> Oh, it is finished. NOw the fifth. Once again he primal number. NOt the . Yes. Of. the . The richard. So we we. So we continue now. Because lengh is good and cgoodlily now let us contnieu. hiya excuse me. The five are anima/s. bceause thety are rising. What five are they. There must be five domains  Onc. One. Two. Three. No. it It does not suffice. The birdh. Now these are over here. The land. It is pure. And so the ail. The hot area. It is cold WWe must move. The third. One two thre. It xis divisible. The heat and it is the desert. We must find five.

        Now, let us then proceed for you, child, oh small child, do believe in the resurrection of the dead. You must, and yes, truly, you do! For everything is meaningless without it. We must fall and then rise. The fall comes first, for we are sinful and wretched. Now we shall present the manifestation of the shapeliness of our existence. Humility we lack, but we must be humbled and laid low.
        </p>
        <p>
        The emptiness, the unit, and the pair are not numbers. These are not their names. Their names emanate with too much presence for us to speak of them. Instead, we must refer to them by their earthly disguises. These are not numbers, for how can they be, for they form the structures of this entire world. He did know, the men and women and, indeed womyn, and thus it is impossible for us to understand the tremendousness of the human condition. And so we must declare, humyn. Dynol and dyniaeth. These do not adequate describe us. So we must say <mark>gwerin</mark>. You are now summoned, and we shall declare, yes truly, that the first number, itself a unity, not the unit, but a unity, for it is indivisible, three.
        </p>
        <p>
        We will enumerate the properties of three. Do not tremble! Prepare yourself. The three represents two dimensions. Flatness and disparity. To a lesser extent than the two. For the two is line. Linearity and direction. The one is empty. The three is two. Then the four is three. A tetrahedron, the plant of Hellen did say. And thus we continue, but remember that the five represents transcendence. Thus it is connected with the <mark>staoniezh</mark>. For is this not also the fifth? No, it is not. I am terrified. The sixth is duality. Goodliness and might. We are jovial. Here and there, counterpart and refutation, and in the midst, centrality. Then the seventh represents itself. And lo, the seventh is, truly, alone.

        I have very little time. It is impertavie. I hasve discornedt the third, xperhaps the fourcht layer of hidde nkwoledge. Sophiu and Sophiam. The male and female are but lies spoken to urge from <mark>demiourgos</mark>, whose greatest desire and wickeudness is nothing more than to punish eus for our malevolent existence which, truly, is he manifestation xof his existunce, and demiourgos must be male, for otherwise all of  its meaning does it lose - no, not few , but all, and this is impenetrable and indenpetideable. Then the emanations that have been revealed to me I shall now display. The five (5) senses ar ebut ilusions inteded and designed by perhaps the devilliest of devils to entrap and enjoin us, ot do unto us the terrible deeds that Yahweh or aklas wished upon his disgutsing creation. Indeed, there are four of them, that oof the ears, that of the eyes, that of the mouth, and that of the nose and if,one considers the distinct properties of each emanation, potentially six. Which averages out to five , as was foretold by the young friends. The younglings. Do not. No, for e must - it is their destiny!
