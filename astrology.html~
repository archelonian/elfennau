        Lo, there are indeed. That is correct, and thus. The first is Mercury. Swift-footed Achilles. The foot is swift, like rushing water. The moon is trembling because it is furious. No, Mercury is the deceiver. The great apostle. Of whom ?? No, the knowledge of the dead. I do not believe - yes !! You do believe, my child. The resurrection (Maimonides) of the (ben david) of the dead. We have. I have (I have) we have (they) no, we do (have it) yes, we have.

        Then the first celestial object of the heavens, the great heavens which rule over us all anddamn us to badliness. I am no longer petrified by your awe, nor am I terrified of you any longer. For here, thus, your secrets are revealed. I banish you forever and ever.

        Here and now, the first secret of yours is this: lo, it is actually the third secret. For what are the first and second secrets ?? The first secret only exists in zero dimensions, and the second in two (2). However, the second exists in one (1) dimension, for every additional secret is arn additional dimension, and indeed it is trequired that there be five (5)sides to penetrate the fourth dimension.

        Now continue shall we no yes we must for it (for it is determined already by the movement) and thus we carry on, trudging along, as did the ones before us who (they were brave and noble but thus do we all, and we must perish because our hubris is insufiicent, no it is too sufficient and thus) we must perish. for For that is. The power and the lgory of the LORD for ever andever. DO NOT do not (never shall we) it is forbidden thus we cannot (no, can we ++) no, it is formibidden. The teutons TEUTONS knew this. and did the nubians. but we have forgotten this truth. And that is why the resurrection was necessary. But Maimodineds does not believe. For he is a fool. Thus, it is goodliness itself. We are true.

        The moon (what is its name) is the first, and thus it is the third. For the first is the earth itself. The great firmament. For it is at the centre, from our view. For we see through a glass darkly. Then it is the first, and so it is the third. Selah. Raise your voice to the heavens. Next is the third, which is the first. Its epriod is ten (1) days. There are three (3) periods. Three (3) and te (10). We shall now reliquish the Arabic tradition and look inwardly into our interiors. The current, not the next (for it has not) for it has not yet come. Thus we (examine, do we) yes, we do (no !! why ) for now it is that hour. The day and the hour. TiME eternal. It cannot be conquered.

        Then (truly) what is it? The answer to our (wat we have) searching for (but we do not, for you did not) the incompletion. It is missing. It lacks. We are at fault. Mercy and raise me. Do not punish me, for this corporeal body is fleshless, for it is only flesh, and thus it is bound by the terror of time itself. And thus we must continue now our journey. What is the next, let us examine. it
        <p>
        Truly I say to you, the first there are three periods of ten dayse What do these represent? The three, for there are three aspects. We find life in three aspects. And these represent the holiest animals. The terrain and the transition statet. It is meaningless. Thus there are only three. The earth nthe sea and the skpy.
